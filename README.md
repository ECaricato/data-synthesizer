# data-synthesizer
Synthesize a given dataset using this project.

The file [synthesize_spotify.ipynb](synthesize_spotify.ipynb) is an example Jupyter-Notebook to demonstrate how to generate a synthetic dataset using data collected from Spotify.  
On the other hand [synth.py](synth.py) shows a general workflow with [SDV](https://sdv.dev/) to synthesize a given dataset (_Note: Eventhough the quality report should work in general, it did not work in my environment as it got stuck no matter how much data I used. If you run into the same issue, you can also get an overview of the quality of the data by using the visualization in the end of the Jupyter-Notebook._)
